TotK DynamicFPS 1.5.4 by /u/ChucksFeedAndSeed
Check https://www.reddit.com/user/ChucksFeedAndSeed/ for updates.

To enable DynamicFPS ensure the "DynamicFPS - v1.5.4 (Main)" mod folder is enabled in your emulator.
With that enabled you can then enable the extra mods marked (xxFPS, where xx is a number) to configure it as you like.
