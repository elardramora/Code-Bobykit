This mod fix the bugged outline on distant Sky Islands when using the setting Resolution scale at 2x. If you use other Resolution scale please use the corresponded version of this mod. 
Sky Island Fixes are not needed if you use Resolution at 1x.

This mod fixes the old "Sky island" outline issue that appears when upscaling. The fix works in an improved way. As a side effect, it fixes a lot of rendering issues, such as shimmering light sources, lighting artifacts, etc.
Here is a summary of the issues fixed, besides the islands outline: https://imgsli.com/MTkwNTA0
